# NetflixCalculator
A simple calculator that helps you figure out what is the current time of the movie/series you are watching...

This is useful until Nextflix is going to let people decide whether they want to see the current time of the movie or the remaining time
The script was created in basic Python and any suggestions are welcomed!
